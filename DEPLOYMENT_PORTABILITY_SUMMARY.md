## Quick Migration Guide

### For Same Domain Migration
```bash
# On old host
./backup-voice-stack.sh --verify

# Transfer backup to new host
rsync -avz voice-stack-backups/ new-host:~/voice-stack-backups/

# On new host
git clone <repository> voice-stack  # or extract backup
cd voice-stack
./restore-voice-stack.sh ~/voice-stack-backups/voice-stack_TIMESTAMP
./deploy.sh start
```

### For Domain Change Migration
```bash
# Additional steps for domain changes
nano .env  # Update SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME and ELEMENT_PUBLIC_URL
./generate-element-config.sh
docker-compose build element
./deploy.sh restart
```

## File Locations and Usage

### New Scripts
```
/config/workspace/voice-stack/generate-element-config.sh  # Dynamic Element config
/config/workspace/voice-stack/backup-voice-stack.sh      # Automated backups
/config/workspace/voice-stack/restore-voice-stack.sh     # Automated restore
```

### Documentation
```
/config/workspace/voice-stack/DEPLOYMENT_PORTABILITY_REPORT.md  # Detailed analysis
/config/workspace/voice-stack/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md                # Step-by-step migration
/config/workspace/voice-stack/PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md       # Deployment checklist

```

## Next Steps for Production Migration

### Immediate (Before Migration)
1. **Create Production Backup**
   ```bash
   ./backup-voice-stack.sh --verify -n pre-migration
   ```

2. **Test Configuration Generator**
   ```bash
   ./generate-element-config.sh
   ```

3. **Prepare New Host**
   - Follow `PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Configure DNS if changing domains
   - Set up SSL termination

### During Migration
1. **Stop Services Gracefully**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh stop
   ```

2. **Transfer Data**
   - Use migration guide procedures
   - Verify data transfer integrity

3. **Restore and Validate**
   ```bash
   ./restore-voice-stack.sh /path/to/backup
   ./deploy.sh start
   ./voice_stack_tests.sh
   ```

### Post-Migration
1. **Verify All Services**
   - Matrix server functionality
   - Element Web interface
   - Voice/video calls
   - Federation (if applicable)

2. **Update DNS/SSL**
   - Point domains to new host
   - Verify SSL certificates

3. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Health checks
   - Log aggregation
   - Backup automation

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- Container orchestration
- Data persistence
- Configuration management
- Service dependencies

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- External IP detection in complex networks
- SSL certificate setup on new host
- DNS propagation delays

### Mitigation Strategies
- Test external IP detection before migration
- Prepare SSL certificates in advance
- Use low TTL for DNS during migration
- Keep old host running during migration window
